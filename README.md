# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. [Original project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)has already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and the first test suite. This testing project required analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## How to run the Feed Reader?

1. Download the repository in your desktop, unzip it and open the "index.html" file in your browser.
2. At the bootom of the page you will see Jasmine visualizations and comments about the tests.
3. If the provided tests will pass the Jasmine section will be green, if fail it turn red.
3. All the tests are described in spec/feedreader.js.
